## Q1

process 0 is at node cs488.hpc.nyu.edu

process 1 is at node cs489.hpc.nyu.edu

pingpong latency: 1.110422e-03 ms

pingpong bandwidth: 1.002979e+01 GB/s

See `slurm\_hwq1.out` for the HPC output.

## Q2



## Q3

I picked the first task: scan with MPI. The output can be found at `slurm\_hwq2q3.out`, where I printed the partial(local) offset of each processors and checked the result against sequential version and got 0 error.

## Q4

I will be doing the project with Yiwei on implementing a sparse attention mechanism (proposed by OpenAI for effciently modeling long sequence in Transformer for large NN models) with OpenMP and MPI.

We have pitched our project at your office the other day.
